# final-project

As stated in the video, I struggled to find a way to have my program wait a designated amount of time before doing something in a way that was concise, understandable (by me), and usable (by me).

finalmenu.py allows you to see how my program was coming along up to the point where I needed to use this method. 
I did my best to try to continue the code in a way that I thought would work, but without that method it would be impossible to test the code and figure out why it didn't work. 
Hopefully the sum total of what I've written in these 2 files does a good job representing my vision.

And in the future, if you ever feel the need for such a program (as I oh so frequently do), check this repo.
I probably finished this project out of boredeom during the first week of winter break.
